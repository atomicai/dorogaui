# Getting Started with hack3-stack

This project was made for rapid and easy project setup and development
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## So... what is hack3-stack? A template?

Yes, specifically for situations when you need to quickly setup your project and have all things needed already configured. The main purpose is hackathons. This template has all the benefits of full-fledged web application (server state manager, global state manager, routing, etc) with easy-to-navigate alternatives for rapid development where time is of the essence. That way, you don't have to worry about nonrelevant stuff and focus on what matters most - development.
